# Covid Act Now API (V1)

## Introduction

The Covid Act Now API provides the same data that powers [CovidActNow.org](https://covidactnow.org) but in an easily digestible, machine readable format, intended for consumption by other COVID websites, models, and tools. Read our [blog post](https://blog.covidactnow.org/covid-act-now-api-intervention-model/) annoucing the API for more context and background.

### Update frequency

Data is updated every day, typically around midnight US Pacific Time.

### Rate Limits

There are no rate limits

## Using the API

Data is available by prefixing URLs with `https://data.covidactnow.org/latest/`

In order to read a model from the API, you must specify both the location (state or county) and the intervention level.

### Location

Specify either:

1. A US State using two letter abbreviation (eg. 'CA' for California)
2. A US County using it's [FIPS Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_county_code) (For a list of FIPS Codes, see [this page on the USDA site](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/home/?cid=nrcs143_013697))

### Invervention Categories

Forward projections are available for the following scenarios:

```js
"NO_MITIGATION",          // No Intervention
"MODERATE_MITIGATION"     // Social Distancing
"HIGH_MITIGATION"         // Stay at Home
```

Additionally the most appropriate static scenario based on the per-state intervention is returned by specifying:

```js
"SELECTED_MITIGATION"
```

To get a dynamic forecast that is based on the actually observed effect of mitigations and other factors in a given state, use:

```js
"OBSERVED_MITIGATION"
```

> Note: `OBSERVED_MITIGATION` is only available for states, not counties.

More information on interventions, including definitions, references, and R0 values used is [available here](https://data.covidactnow.org/Covid_Act_Now_Model_References_and_Assumptions.pdf).

### Fetching State Data
#### Reading a Projection for a Specific State

Returns projections for the selected state

```bash
# Current actuals + projections + limits
# e.g. https://data.covidactnow.org/latest/us/states/CA.OBSERVED_MITIGATION.json
/us/states/<ST>.<INTERVENTION>.json

# Full timeseries data: actuals + projected limits + data for every four days
# e.g. https://data.covidactnow.org/latest/us/states/CA.OBSERVED_MITIGATION.timeseries.json 
/us/states/<ST>.<INTERVENTION>.timeseries.json
```

#### Reading Aggregate Projections for All States

Returns projections for all states

```bash
# Current actuals + projections + limits
# e.g. https://data.covidactnow.org/latest/us/states.OBSERVED_MITIGATION.json
/us/states.<INTERVENTION>.json

# Timeseries data
# e.g. https://data.covidactnow.org/latest/us/states.OBSERVED_MITIGATION.timeseries.json
/us/states.<INTERVENTION>.timeseries.json
```

State aggregates are also available as CSV files:
    
```bash
# Current actuals + projections + limits
# e.g. https://data.covidactnow.org/latest/us/states.OBSERVED_MITIGATION.csv
/latest/us/states.<INTERVENTION>.csv

# Timeseries data
# E.G. https://data.covidactnow.org/latest/us/states.OBSERVED_MITIGATION.timeseries.csv
/latest/us/states.<INTERVENTION>.timeseries.csv
```

### Fetching County Data
#### Reading a Projection for a Specific County

Returns projections for the selected county
    
```bash
# Current actuals + projections + limits
# e.g. https://data.covidactnow.org/latest/us/counties/06077.SELECTED_MITIGATION.json
/us/counties/<5-DIGIT-FIPS>.<INTERVENTION>.json 

# Full timeseries data: actuals + projected limits + data for every four days
# e.g. https://data.covidactnow.org/latest/us/counties/06077.SELECTED_MITIGATION.timeseries.json
/latest/us/counties/<5-DIGIT-FIPS>.<INTERVENTION>.timeseries.json 
```

#### Reading Aggregate Projections for All Counties

Returns projections for all counties

```bash
# Current actuals + projections + limits
# e.g. https://data.covidactnow.org/latest/us/counties.SELECTED_MITIGATION.json
/us/counties.<INTERVENTION>.json

# Timeseries data
# e.g. https://data.covidactnow.org/latest/us/counties.SELECTED_MITIGATION.timeseries.json
/us/counties.<INTERVENTION>.timeseries.json
```

County aggregates are also available as CSV files:
    
```bash
# Current actuals + projections + limits
# e.g. https://data.covidactnow.org/latest/us/counties.SELECTED_MITIGATION.csv
/latest/us/counties.<INTERVENTION>.csv

# Timeseries data
# e.g. https://data.covidactnow.org/latest/us/counties.SELECTED_MITIGATION.timeseries.csv
/latest/us/counties.<INTERVENTION>.timeseries.csv
```

### Data format:

This is the data format for both states and counties. `timeseries` is only included when requesting `*.timeseries.json` or `*.timeseries.csv`.
```jsonc
{
  country,
  stateName,
  countyName, // null for states
  fips, // 2 digit for states, 5 digit for counties
  lat, 
  long,
  lastUpdatedDate, // ISO 8601 date string
  actuals: {
    population,
    intervention, // one of (NO_MITIGATION, MODERATE_MITIGATION, stay_at_home)
    cumulativeConfirmedCases,
    cumulativeDeaths,
    hospitalBeds: {
      capacity,
      currentUsage, // Coming soon where available, null currently
    }, 
    ICUBeds: { same as above }  // Coming soon where available, null currently
  }, 
  projections: {
    totalHospitalBeds: {
      shortageStartDate, // null if no shortage projected
      peakDate,
      peakShortfall
    },
    ICUBeds: { same as above }, // Coming soon where available, null currently
  },
  timeseries: [{
    date,
    hospitalBedsRequired,
    hospitalBedCapacity,
    ICUBedsInUse,
    ICUBedCapacity, // Coming soon where availabe, null currently
    cumulativeDeaths,
    cumulativeInfected,
  }],
};
```
