The Covid Act Now API provides access to all of our COVID data tracking US states, counties, and metros.

It includes data and metrics for [cases](/data-definitions#cases),
[vaccinations](/data-definitions#vaccinations), [tests](/data-definitions#tests),
[hospitalizations](/data-definitions#hospitalizations), and [deaths](/data-definitions#deaths).
See [data definitions](/data-definitions) for all included data.

The API provides the same data that powers [Covid Act Now](https://covidactnow.org)
but in easily digestible CSV or JSON files, intended for consumption by other COVID websites, models, and tools.

## Register

import SignupForm from "@site/src/components/SignupForm";

## Data endpoints

In the examples below, replace `YOUR_KEY_HERE` with the API key from Step 1 above.

The Covid Act Now API has coverage for states, counties, and metro areas (CBSAs). You can query the data in CSV or JSON formats.

Learn how to query:

- **[Current data for all states, counties, and metros](#current-data-for-all-states-counties-or-metros)**
- **[Historic data for all states, counties, and metros](#historic-data-for-all-states-counties-or-metros)**
- **[Data for an individual state, county, or metro area](#data-for-individual-locations)**
- **[Aggregated US data](#aggregated-us-data)**

Details on the contents of each endpoint are available in the [API Reference](/api)

### Current data for all states, counties, or metros

These endpoints contain the latest available data (a single, scalar value per field) for all states, counties, and CBSAs (metros).

Each file contains all locations in the region type.
For example, `https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/counties.csv?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE` contains all US counties.

#### CSV format

```
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/states.csv?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/counties.csv?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/cbsas.csv?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

Read the API Reference for [/v2/states.csv](/api/#tag/State-Data/paths/~1states.csv?apiKey={apiKey}/get), [/v2/counties.csv](/api#tag/County-Data/paths/~1counties.csv?apiKey={apiKey}/get), [/v2/cbsas.csv](/api#tag/CBSA-Data/paths/~1cbsa~1{cbsa_code}.json?apiKey={apiKey}/get).

#### JSON format

```
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/states.json?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/counties.json?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/cbsas.json?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

### Historic data for all states, counties, or metros

These files contain the entire history (a timeseries for every field) for all states, counties, and cbsas (metros).

#### CSV format

```
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/states.timeseries.csv?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/counties.timeseries.csv?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/cbsas.timeseries.csv?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

Read the API reference for [/v2/states.timeseries.csv](/api#tag/State-Data/paths/~1states.timeseries.csv?apiKey={apiKey}/get), [/v2/counties.timeseries.csv](/api#tag/County-Data/paths/~1counties.timeseries.csv?apiKey={apiKey}/get),
[/v2/cbsas.timeseries.csv](/api#tag/CBSA-Data/paths/~1cbsas.timeseries.csv?apiKey={apiKey}/get)

#### JSON format

```
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/states.timeseries.json?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/counties.timeseries.json?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/cbsas.timeseries.json?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

:::note

As `/v2/counties.timeseries.json` contains historic data for every county, it is very large. If you are looking for counties in a single state, consider
downloading [counties for a single state](#data-for-all-counties-in-a-state).

:::

### Data for individual locations

It's easy to query a single state, county, or metro area.

#### Current data

```
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/state/{state}.json?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/county/{fips}.json?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/cbsa/{cbsa_code}.json?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

#### Historic data

```
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/state/{state}.timeseries.json?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/state/{state}.timeseries.csv?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/county/{fips}.timeseries.json?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/cbsa/{cbsa_code}.timeseries.json?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

#### Data for all counties in a state

You can also query all counties for a single state.

```
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/county/{state}.json?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/county/{state}.csv?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/county/{state}.timeseries.json?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/county/{state}.timeseries.csv?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

#### Aggregated US data

We also calculate country-wide data for the entire US.

```
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/country/US.json?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/country/US.timeseries.json?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/country/US.timeseries.csv?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
```
