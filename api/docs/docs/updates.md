description: Updates to the Covid Act Now API.
---

Updates to the API will be reflected here.

### Link to Covid Act Now website
_Added on 2020-12-03_

Each region now includes a field `url` that points to the Covid Act Now location page
for that region.

### Upcoming risk level update
_Added on 2020-12-01_

We modified our risk levels to include a 5th level on
[covidactnow.org](https://covidactnow.org) for locations experiencing a
severe outbreak. On **Monday, December 7th** we will be updating the risk levels
in the API to reflect this.

If you have any code depending on 4 risk levels, you will need to update
it to include the fifth risk level.

This change directly affects the fields `riskLevels.overall` and `riskLevels.caseDensity`.

```diff
RiskLevel:
    LOW = 0
    MEDIUM = 1
    HIGH = 2
    CRITICAL = 3
    UNKNOWN = 4
+   EXTREME = 5
```

If you would like to include the new risk level right now to reflect what
is currently on [covidactnow.org](https://covidactnow.org), you can do so by
classifying both `overall` and `caseDensity` risk as extreme for any location
where `actuals.casesDensity > 75`.

### Query by CBSA
_Added on 2020-11-09_

We added [core-based statistical area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core-based_statistical_area)
endpoints to the API.

You can now view results aggregated by CBSA:
```bash

### Increase county test positivity coverage
_Added on 2020-11-04_

We increased our test positivity coverage for counties by adding in data
from U.S. Department of Health & Human Services as aggregated by the
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. See our [data sources](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XmKCBWYZr9VQKFAdWh_D7pkpGGM_oR9cPjj-UrNdMJQ/edit#slide=id.ga721750846_35_117)
for more information.

### Add new cases field with outlier detection
_Added on 2020-10-29_

In addition to cumulative case counts, we added a `New Cases` field to all
`actuals` and `actualsTimeseries` values.  The `New Cases` field computes new
cases and applies outlier detection to remove erratic case values.  

### Add `locationId` field
_Added on 2020-10-27_

Adds a generic location ID used to represent regions.  Will allow for 
greater flexibility as we add more aggregation levels (such as country).

### Add `riskLevels`
_Added on 2020-10-15_

Added risk levels as seen on [covidactnow.org](https://covidactnow.org) to
the API.
