## Cases

### Cases

  Cumulative confirmed or suspected cases.

**Where to access**  
* CSV column names: ``actuals.cases``
* JSON file fields: ``actuals.cases``, ``actualsTimeseries.*.cases``

### New Cases

  New confirmed or suspected cases.

New cases are a processed timeseries of cases - summing new cases may not equal
the cumulative case count.

Processing steps:
 1. If a region does not report cases for a period of time but then begins reporting again,
    we will exclude the first day that reporting recommences. This first day likely includes
    multiple days worth of cases and can be misleading to the overall series.
 2. We remove any days with negative new cases.
 3. We apply an outlier detection filter to the timeseries, which removes any data
    points that seem improbable given recent numbers. Many times this is due to
    backfill of previously unreported cases.

**Where to access**  
* CSV column names: ``actuals.newCases``
* JSON file fields: ``actuals.newCases``, ``actualsTimeseries.*.newCases``

### Case Density

  The number of cases per 100k population calculated using a 7-day rolling average.

* CSV column names: ``metrics.caseDensity``
* JSON file fields: ``metrics.caseDensity``, ``metricsTimeseries.*.caseDensity``

### Infection Rate

  R_t, or the estimated number of infections arising from a typical case.

**Where to access**  
* CSV column names: ``metrics.infectionRate``

### Infection Rate Ci90

  90th percentile confidence interval upper endpoint of the infection rate.

**Where to access**  
* CSV column names: ``metrics.infectionRateCI90``
* JSON file fields: ``metrics.infectionRateCI90``, ``metricsTimeseries.*.infectionRateCI90``
