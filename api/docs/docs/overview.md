Welcome to the documentation for the Covid Act Now API.

These docs describe version 2 of the API.
Documentation for the previous version of the API is available [here](https://github.com/covid-projections/covid-data-model/blob/master/api/README.V1.md).

The API provides the same data that powers [Covid Act Now](https://covidactnow.org)
but in an easily digestible, machine readable format, intended for consumption by other COVID websites, models, and tools.

:::note
