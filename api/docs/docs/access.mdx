## Getting started

In the examples below, replace `YOUR_KEY_HERE` with the API key from Step 1 above.

The Covid Act Now API has coverage for states, counties, and metro areas (CBSAs). You can query the data in CSV or JSON formats.

Learn how to query:

- **[Current values for all states, counties, and metros](#current-values-for-all-states-counties-or-metros)**
- **[Historic values for all states, counties, and metros](#historic-values-for-all-states-counties-or-metros)**
- **[Current and historic values for an individual state, county, or metro area](#individual-locations)**

### Current values for all states, counties, or metros

These endpoints contain the latest available data for all states, counties, and cbsas (metros).

Each file contains all locations in the region type.
For example, `https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/counties.csv?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE` contains all US counties.

#### CSV format

```
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/states.csv?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/counties.csv?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/cbsas.csv?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

```bash
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/states.timeseries.json?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/counties.timeseries.json?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/cbsas.timeseries.json?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

:::note

As ``/v2/counties.timeseries.json`` contains historic data for every county, it is very large. If you are looking for counties in a single state, consider
downloading [counties for a single state](#all-counties-in-a-state).

### Individual Locations

It's easy to query a single state, county, or metro area.

#### Current Values

```
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/state/{state}.timeseries.json?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/county/{fips}.timeseries.json?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/cbsa/{cbsa_code}.timeseries.json?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE

https://api.covidactnow.org/v2/cbsa/{cbsa_code}.timeseries.json?apiKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

#### All counties in a state
