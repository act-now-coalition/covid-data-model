# COVID-19 Data Model

*Objective:* Provide a library/API that ingests COVID-19 data to provide simulated outcomes based on local isolation/quarantine policy levers as represented in published models.

### Data Sources
See [covid-data-public](https://github.com/covid-projections/covid-data-public) for data sources being used or considered.


## [Setup](./SETUP.md)

# API Snapshots

We automatically build & publish an API snapshot (e.g. https://data.covidactnow.org/snapshot/123/)
twice a day via a [github action](./.github/workflows/deploy_api.yml).  To manually kick off a new
snapshot, get a
[personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line),
and run:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR PERSONAL GITHUB TOKEN>
./tools/push-api.sh
```

Once a snapshot has been vetted, you can "label" it with a friendly name, e.g. pointing https://data.covidactnow.org/v0/ at https://data.covidactnow.org/snapshot/123/ with:
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR PERSONAL GITHUB TOKEN>
./tools/label-api.sh v0 123
```

# Development

### Run website data deploy

This will run all models and generate data needed for the website, outputting to ``../covid-projections/public/data``.
```bash
./deploy_website.sh
```

# Sentry
In order to have sentry run locally and report errors to the dev sentry
instance, add the following to your .env

```
export SENTRY_DSN=https://<GET_SENTRY_DSN_FOR_DEV_INSTANCE>.ingest.sentry.io/<DEV_INSTANCE>
```

The gitub action pulls the sentry_dsn for the prod instance from a secrets stored within github.

# Downloading Model Run Data

You can download recent model data output from the github action:
```
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR PERSONAL GITHUB TOKEN>
./run.py utils download-model-artifact --run-number <optional run number>
```
By default it downloads the last run, but you can choose a specific run with `--run-number`


# PySEIR Setup

## Installation

Recommend virtualenv or miniconda python 3.7 from here
[https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

If using conda, you can use the following:
- `conda create python=3.7 -n covid-data-model`
- `conda activate covid-data-model`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements_test.txt`

### Running Models
PySEIR provides a command line interface in the activated environment. You can access the model with `pyseir --help ` and `pyseir <subcommand> --help` providing more information.

Example:
`pyseir build-all --states="New York"` will run state and county models for New York.
States can also be specified by their state code: `--states="New York"` and `--states=NY` are equivalent.


Check the `output/` folder for results.

### Model Output

There are a variety of output artifacts to paths described in pyseir/utils.py.
The main artifact is the ensemble_result which contains the output information
for each `suppression policy -> model compartment` as well as capacity
information.
