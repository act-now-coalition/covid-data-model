# COVID-19 Data Model

*Objective:* Provide a library/API that ingests COVID-19 data to provide simulated outcomes based on local isolation/quarantine policy levers as represented in published models.

### Data Sources
See [covid-data-public](https://github.com/covid-projections/covid-data-public) for data sources being used or considered.


## [Setup](./SETUP.md)

# API Snapshots

We automatically build & publish an API snapshot (e.g. https://data.covidactnow.org/snapshot/123/) 
twice a day via a [github action](./.github/workflows/deploy_api.yml).  To manually kick off a new
snapshot, get a
[personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line),
and run:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR PERSONAL GITHUB TOKEN>
./tools/push-api.sh
```

Once a snapshot has been vetted, you can "label" it with a friendly name, e.g. pointing https://data.covidactnow.org/v0/ at https://data.covidactnow.org/snapshot/123/ with:
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR PERSONAL GITHUB TOKEN>
./tools/label-api.sh v0 123
```

# Development

### Run website data deploy

This will run all models and generate data needed for the website, outputting to ``../covid-projections/public/data``.
```bash
./deploy_website.sh
```

### Run DoD dataset deploy
Run all models, generate DoD datasets, output to `./dod_results/` folder:
```bash
./deploy_dod.sh
```

Run all models, generate DoD datasets, upload the files to S3 bucket specified by `BUCKET_NAME`.
```bash
BUCKET_NAME=<bucket name> ./deploy_dod.sh
```

If you've previously ran the full model, you can just re-run the DoD dataset part via:
```
# Output artifacts locally to dod_results/:
python deploy_dod_dataset.py
# Upload artifacts to S3 bucket:
BUCKET_NAME=<bucket name> python deploy_dod_dataset.py
```

# Sentry
In order to have sentry run locally and report errors to the dev sentry instance, add the following to your .env
```
export SENTRY_DSN=https://<GET_SENTRY_DSN_FOR_DEV_INSTANCE>.ingest.sentry.io/<DEV_INSTANCE>
```

The gitub action pulls the sentry_dsn for the prod instance from a secrets stored within github. 

# [NEW 4/7] PySEIR Setup

## Installation

Install miniconda python 3.7 from here [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

Execute
`conda env create -f environment.yaml`

Activate the environment here..
`conda activate pyseir`

### Installing pyseir
Change to into the county_covid_seir_models directory
`pip install -e .`


### Running Models
Example here. You can remove the `--state` flag to run everything. To run only states, add `--states-only`.
`pyseir run-all --run-mode='can-before-hospitalization-new-params' --output-interval-days=4 --state="California"`

`pyseir --help ` and `pyseir <subcommand> --help` also provide specific flags. 

Check the `output/` folder for results.
