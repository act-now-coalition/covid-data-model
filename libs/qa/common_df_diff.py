"""
Compare two dataframes loaded from CSV files. The files must have a single key column, currently
named `fips` and a single time column named `date`. All other columns are treated as timeseries
points to be compared. The column name of timeseries points is pivoted/stacked/melted to the
`variable` column. A timeseries is the sequence of points from the same original column, with the
same fips and is identified by the <fips, variable> pair. A file is said to contain a timeseries
with identity <fips, variable> if the melted representation contains it contains at least one
row for the <fips, variable> and a real (not NaN) value.

This tool helps us find differences between files by aggregating the sets of timeseries in the files
and outputting the differences.

First timeseries points that appear in the same file more than once are dropped and output. A
summary of the set of timeseries that appear in exactly one file is output. Then the common
timeseries are compared. A summary of timeseries points that appear in exactly one file are output.
sections of the timeseries that appear in both files are compared and the amount of difference is
aggregated and output.


Proposed output per variable:

Variable: 'cases'

Duplicate TS points dropped:
    Left: FIPS xxyyy, xxyyy
    Right: FIPS xxyyy, xxyyy
Missing TS:
    Left only: FIPS xxyyy, xxyyy
    Right only: FIPS xxyyy, xxyyy
TS Points Missing:
    Left only Jun 21: FIPS xxyyy, xxyyy
    Left only Jun 20: FIPS xxyyy, xxyyy
    Left only Jun 19: FIPS xxyyy, xxyyy
    Left only Jun 18-11: FIPS xxyyy, xxyyy
    Left only Jun 10 - May 10: FIPS xxyyy, xxyyy
Common TS:
    No time range overlap: FIPS xxyyyy, ...
    1-10 point overlap: most diff 0.4 FIPS xxyyy, median diff 0.2 FIPS xxyyy, least diff 0.01 FIPS xxyyy
    11-21 point overlap: most diff 0.4 FIPS xxyyy, median diff 0.2 FIPS xxyyy, least diff 0.01 FIPS xxyyy


Proposed way to print a bunch of FIPS:
FIPS 5 states (xx, yy, zz, ...) and 6 counties (xxyyy, xxyyy, ... OR by state TX: 10, TN 10, ...)
